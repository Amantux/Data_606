<H1> Proposal </H1>

With all the focus on maintaining and developing stem talent, I've always wanted to see if STEM degrees commend a price premium. 

In terms of definition of a STEM degree, I'll be using DHS's STEM CIPs Code List (Found here: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/stemList2022.pdf)

In addition I will crosswalk the Major Code to CIPs using a crosswalk table defined in:
https://forum.ipums.org/t/crosswalk-between-degfieldd-and-cip/4209

Which is allegedly sourced via the census Bureau.

<H1> Data Read In </H1>

```{r}
url.data <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/college-majors/all-ages.csv"
raw <- read.csv(url(url.data), header = TRUE,)
summary(raw)
glimpse(raw)
```

<H1> Cases </H1>

There are 173 cases in this data set. This data is mostly summaries effectively grouped buy the major code

<h1> Type of Study </H1>

This is an observational study.

<h1> Data Sourcing </h1>

There are 3 primary resources:

Data 538-https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/college-majors/all-ages.csv
U.S. Census-Crosswalk table-https://forum.ipums.org/t/crosswalk-between-degfieldd-and-cip/4209
DHS-https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/stemList2022.pdf

<h1> Response Variable </h1>

The Response variable is the income rate, and its numerical. 


<h1> Explanatory Variable </H1>


The Explanatory variable is the classification of the CIP code (Ie STEM or not STEM)

<H1> Summary Stats </H1>

```{r}
summary(raw)
```



<H1> Pretty Charts </H1>

```{r}
mean <- mean(raw$Median)
sd   <- sd(raw$Median)
ggplot(data = raw, aes(x = Median)) +
        geom_blank() +
        geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..)) +
        stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = c(mean = mean, sd = sd), col = "tomato")
```
