<H1> Proposal </H1>

With all the focus on maintaining and developing stem talent, I've always wanted to see if STEM degrees commend a price premium. 

In terms of definition of a STEM degree, I'll be using DHS's STEM CIPs Code List (Found here: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/stemList2022.pdf)

In addition I will crosswalk the Major Code to CIPs using a crosswalk table defined in:
https://forum.ipums.org/t/crosswalk-between-degfieldd-and-cip/4209

Which is allegedly sourced via the census Bureau.

<H1> Data Read In </H1>

```{r}
url.data <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/college-majors/all-ages.csv"
raw <- read.csv(url(url.data), header = TRUE,)
summary(raw)
glimpse(raw)
```

<H1> Cases </H1>

There are 173 cases in this data set. This data is mostly summaries effectively grouped buy the major code

<h1> Type of Study </H1>

This is an observational study.

<h1> Data Sourcing </h1>

There are 3 primary resources:

Data 538-https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/college-majors/all-ages.csv
U.S. Census-Crosswalk table-https://forum.ipums.org/t/crosswalk-between-degfieldd-and-cip/4209
DHS-hhttps://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Document/2016/stem-list.pdf

<h1> Response Variable </h1>

The Response variable is the income rate, and its numerical. 


<h1> Explanatory Variable </H1>


The Explanatory variable is the classification of the CIP code (Ie STEM or not STEM)

<H1> Summary Stats </H1>

```{r}
summary(raw)
```



<H1> Pretty Charts </H1>

```{r}
mean <- mean(raw$Median)
sd   <- sd(raw$Median)
ggplot(data = raw, aes(x = Median)) +
        geom_blank() +
        geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..)) +
        stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = c(mean = mean, sd = sd), col = "tomato")
```


<H1> Let's read in data </h1>

The main goal of this project is to look at the data set and determine how a STEM degree affects salary. Going down this avenue, I think we want to look into two parameter, the Total Salary (raw$total) as well as the CIP code two-digit sequence (which is a ).

```{r}
url.data <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Amantux/Data_606/main/Project/CIP_2010_Codes_Stem.csv"
stem_cip_codes <- read.csv(url(url.data), header = TRUE,)
summary(stem_cip_codes)
glimpse(stem_cip_codes)
```
```{r}
url.data <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Amantux/Data_606/main/Project/PUMS_To_CIP_2010.csv"
cip_pums_lookup <- read.csv(url(url.data), header = TRUE,)
summary(cip_pums_lookup)
glimpse(cip_pums_lookup)
cip_pums_lookup
```





<H1> Let's join the data </h1>

```{r}

data <- left_join(raw, cip_pums_lookup, by.x="Major_code", by.y="PUMS")

```
